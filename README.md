## HomeService

The "HomeService" app is built with Django Rest Framework to facilitate users in defining and accessing services. This project employs SimpleJWT for secure authentication and token management, ensuring a robust and secure user experience.

## Overview

- **Service Definition and Access:** HomeService allows users to define and access services. Users can create, update, and delete services, apply to available services, and check their applied services.

- **SimpleJWT for Authentication:** Secure authentication is implemented using SimpleJWT, providing a reliable and secure token management system.

- **Organized API Endpoints:** The API endpoints are logically organized, offering features such as retrieving service lists, viewing detailed service information, and accessing statistics related to specific service topics.

- **Best Practices Project Structure:** The project structure follows best practices, incorporating modules like 'account,' 'backend,' 'nextjs,' 'service,' and 'utils.' This ensures efficient development and maintenance.
